# Progress Report

### Weighted Activity Selection
The weighted activity selection program is almost finished.  
It reads either a default input file (test.in) or a file from a specified path, solves the problem from the file, and writes the solution to an output file.  
  
  
### Huffman Code
Made Main, Compressor, and Decompressor classes.  
The Main class parses the command line arguments and calls the appropriate class.  
Compressor and Decompressor classes are empty right now.
